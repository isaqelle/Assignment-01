<h1>Java OOP Project - HKR</h1>
This repository contains the implementation of various tasks from the Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at HKR. The project includes three tasks, with the second and third tasks also incorporating Gradle for dependency management and build automation.

The project consists of the following tasks:

<h3><b>Task 01: Rock, Paper, Scissors & Dice Game </b></h3>
This task features two games:

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game: A simple implementation of the classic game where the user plays against the computer.
Dice Game: A fun dice game where the user competes by rolling dice and achieving the highest value.

<h3><b>Task 02: Employee Management Application </b></h3>This task involves an employee management system that includes functions such as adding a new employee to a team, assigning them a job, and generating a salary report.

<h3><b>Task 03: Adlez Game</b></h3>
In this game, the user must navigate their way to a designated home point without getting caught by wolves. The game contains features like adding items to a grid (gameplan), setting game difficulty and choosing a game avatar.
