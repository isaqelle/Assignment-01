    <h1>Java OOP Project - HKR</h1>
    <p>This repository contains the implementation of various tasks from the <strong>Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong> course at <strong>HKR</strong>. The project includes three tasks, with the second and third tasks also incorporating <strong>Gradle</strong> for dependency management and build automation.</p>

    <h2>Project Structure</h2>
    <p>The project consists of the following tasks:</p>

    <h3>Task 01: Rock, Paper, Scissors & Dice Game</h3>
    <p>This task involves two games:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Rock, Paper, Scissors Game</strong>: A simple implementation of the classic game where the user plays against the computer.</li>
        <li><strong>Dice Game</strong>: A fun dice game where the user competes by rolling dice and achieving the highest value.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Task 02: Employee Management Application</h3>
    <p>This task features an employee management system with two types of employees:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Employees</strong>: Basic employee functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Superemployees</strong>: Employees with advanced features and privileges.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Task 03: Homepoint Escape Game</h3>
    <p>In this game, the user must navigate their way to a designated home point without getting caught by wolves. The game provides a strategic challenge where the player needs to avoid enemies and reach safety.</p>

    <h2>Running the Programs</h2>
    <p>For detailed instructions on how to run each program, please refer to the individual README file within each task's folder in the project directory.</p>

    <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Java</strong> (for object-oriented programming)</li>
        <li><strong>Gradle</strong> (for build automation, used in Task 02 and Task 03)</li>
    </ul>
