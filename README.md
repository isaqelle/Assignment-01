<h1><b>Java OOP Project - HKR</b></h1>
This repository contains Assignment 1 of the Object-Oriented Programming (Java) course at HKR. The project includes three tasks, with the second and third tasks utilizing Gradle for dependency management and build automation.

The project consists of the following tasks:

<h3><b>Task 01: Rock, Paper, Scissors & Dice Game </b></h3>
This task features two games:
