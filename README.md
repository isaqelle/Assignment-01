Java OOP Project - HKR
This repository contains the implementation of various tasks from the Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) course at HKR. The project includes three tasks, with the second and third tasks also incorporating Gradle for dependency management and build automation.

Project Structure
The project consists of the following tasks:

Task 01: Rock, Paper, Scissors & Dice Game
This task features two games:

Rock, Paper, Scissors Game: A simple implementation of the classic game where the user plays against the computer.
Dice Game: A fun dice game where the user competes by rolling dice and achieving the highest value.

Task 02: Employee Management Application
This task involves an employee management system with two types of employees:

Employees: Basic employee functionality.
Superemployees: Employees with advanced features and privileges.
Task 03: Homepoint Escape Game
In this game, the user must navigate their way to a designated home point without getting caught by wolves. The game presents a strategic challenge where the player needs to avoid enemies and reach safety.

Running the Programs
For detailed instructions on how to run each program, please refer to the individual README file within each task's folder in the project directory.

Technologies Used
Java (for object-oriented programming)
Gradle (for build automation, used in Task 02 and Task 03)
